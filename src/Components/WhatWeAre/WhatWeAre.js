          </div>
          <p>
            The founder of Food For The Nations, Joanne Henry, and her two
            children, Monique and Jovan, began feeding the homeless on Easter
            and Thanksgiving in New York City. Joanne spent a few years not only
            giving the meals but sharing a word of encouragement and hope for a
            better tomorrow. The family also took clothing and toys to the kids
            who lived at the shelters, at this time a close friend joined the
            group as Joanneâ€™s desire to do more became evident. As a single
            parent of two kids she understood the story of some and helped in
            whatever way she could. Her faith being the motivator.

            In 2007, after a years of witnessing the harsh reality of
            homelessness and food insecurity, Food For The Nations was formed
            and registered as a non profit organization.
